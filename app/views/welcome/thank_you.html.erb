He has competently helped us ” with routine tasks, such as hedge cutting and is currently maintaining my mother's garden on a regular basis, undertaking tasks at his own discretion to prepare the garden for Spring. What a treasure he is proving to be!</p>

                            <blockquote><p>Andy and his team performed miracles.  They turned a scruffy and demoralising back garden into an inviting space which I can't believe is mine. They found really lovely turf and laid it perfectly.  They sourced and put up new fences, relocated the garden gate (and made a new one from scratch).  They sorted out the woodwork inside the shed and the guttering, water butt, gravelling and the rest.    It's not just the work that is impressive, but the way in which the work is done: always positive, always on time, always tidy, always checking that things are as they should be and always suggesting some really good ideas about what can be done.  I am both delighted and relieved that Andy and his team were recommended to me, and I am more than happy to recommend them to you as well</p>
